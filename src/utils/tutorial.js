    title: 'The Method of Loci?',
    subtitle:
      'The method of loci is a memorisation technique first recorded in Ancient Greece.\n\nIt is a method of memorising information by placing each item to be remembered at a point along an imaginary journey. The information can then be recalled in a specific order by retracing the same route through the imaginary journey.',

    title: 'Mandaloci',
    subtitle:
      'Mandaloci uses a variant of this technique to ultimately teach you HOW to learn Chinese characters.\n\nThere are three major aspects to learn in total:\n\n  -Actors\n  -Locations\n  -Props',
  },
  {
    title: 'A Word of Warning',
    subtitle:
      "Mandaloci assumes you know about pinyin, the system native Chinese use when they start connecting the Chinese sounds they know to written characters.\n\nIt is not recommended to learn Chinese pronunciation using pinyin, at least not until you've heard how each syllable sounds first.\n\nFor his reason, Mandaloci is not aimed at complete beginners of Chinese.",

  {
    title: 'OK',
    subtitle: "Now that's out of the way, let's get started!.",

  {
    title: 'Actors',

    title: 'Locations',

      "Okay, let's start with a simple character:\n\n  十\n\n十 is Chinese for the number 10, and has the pinyin pronunciation 'shí'.\n\n",
  },
  {
    title: 'shí',
    subtitle:
      "The pinyin 'shí' can be broken down into an initial:\n\n  sh-\n\nAnd a final:\n\n  -Ø (Null)\n\nLet's start by assigning an actor to the initial 'sh-'.",

    title: 'sh-',

  {
    title: 'Anyone?',
    subtitle:
      'To make them easier to connect to the pinyin initial however, it will be much easier to assign someone whose name is similar to either the spelling or pronunciation of the initial.\n\nIn this case, there are endless options, but to name a few:\n\n  -Sean Connery\n\n  -Sean Bean\n\n  -My friend Sharon',
  },
  {
    title: 'No Mr. Bond. I expect you to die',

      "Let's choose Sean Connery to represent the initial 'sh-'.\n\nNow we can move onto the pinyin final '-Ø (Null)'!",
  },
  {
    title: '-Ø (Null)',
    subtitle:
      "The pinyin final will be represented by a location rather than an actor. As you should know, Chinese has 4 (with a neutral 5th) tones. The location we choose for the final '-Ø (Null)' will also have 4 distinct rooms. A setup I recommend is:\n\n  1st Tone: Outside\n\n  2nd Tone: Kitchen\n\n  3rd Tone: Bedroom\n\n  4th Tone: Bathroom\n\nRather than follow this guide (or if your chosen locations don't feature all these rooms), you can choose any other rooms or places, as long as they are mostly similar for all finals.\n\nFor this final, I will be choosing my childhood home.",
  },
  {
    title: 'Props...',
    subtitle:
      "Now that the pinyin is dealt with, we can focus on the character itself. 十 is compromised of two components:\n\n  一\n\n  丨\n\nWhen assigning props to components, we can choose to use either the appearance or the meaning, whichever is more memorable.\n\nFor 一, I'm going to pick a cigar, and for 丨 a staff.",
  },
  {
    title: '十',
    subtitle:
      "Now that we have all the components of the character 十, we can finally create our 'journey'.\n\nThe goal of this step is to imagine a scene in which all those components interact to arrive at the meaning: ten. For this character, I'll give you the scene I created:\n\nSean Connery is in my childhood kitchen. He pulls out a cigar and starts to smoke it when a glowing staff crashes through the roof and lands right in front of him. A bellow of smoke erupts from the tip of the staff until it explodes, launching fireworks all over the room. Connery stands back, the cigar falls from his mouth and he gives the performance before him a 'Ten out of ten!'.",

    subtitle:
      "How'd you find that? That concludes the method for the character 十. Feel free to use the scene I created, but you're encouraged to create your own and really make it unique and special.\n\nThe next few screens will outline the same process for another character, and after that, you're free to make new scenes for any character!",

  {
    title: '干',
    subtitle:
      "The next character, 干, means 'dry', and it has the pinyin 'gān'. The initial here is 'g-', so let's choose Gordon Ramsay for the actor. The final, is '-an', so I'm going to picks my Nan's house for this. One of the props we already know: 一. The second prop is the character we just learned: 十. It reminds me of a cross/crucifix, so I'm going to pick that. Now onto the scene!\n\nGordon Ramsay is standing outside my Nan's house. He suddenly hears a loud bang above him, and before he has a chance to look, a staff crashes into the floor in front of him. Not a second later, it starts raining. Heavy. It isn't long before Gordon is up to his neck in water. He takes out a cross from his front pocket, holds it to the sky and shouts 'It's too wet! I wanted it dry!'. Something answers him, and as the clouds part, the sun shines through, and the water drains away. Gordon looks down at his clothes and he's relieved to see he's still dry.",
